Welcome to openSVAI's documentation!
====================================

openSVAI is a project aimed at:

(1) open-sourcing utility code and bash scripts to reduce repetitive implementations and environment set-ups from SVAI members; 

(2) providing various end-to-end module baselines for common tasks, e.g., human candidates detection, keypoints regression and pose tracking; 

(3) standardizing end-to-end module outputs so that different methods may co-exist in a single module; 

(4) implementing a centralized program that calls different modules based on a configuration file, the modules of which can be from different deep learning frameworks.
